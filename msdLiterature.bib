  Abstract                 = {{This paper deals with the computation of control invariant sets for constrained nonlinear systems. The proposed approach is based on the computation of an inner approximation of the one step set, that is, the set of states that can be steered to a given target set by an admissible control action. Based on this procedure, control invariant sets can be computed by recursion. We present a method for the computation of the one-step set using interval arithmetic. The proposed specialized branch and bound algorithm provides an inner approximation with a given bound of the error; this makes it possible to achieve a trade off between accuracy of the computed set and computational burden. Furthermore an algorithm to approximate the one step set by an inner bounded polyhedron is also presented; this allows us to relax the complexity of the obtained set, and to make easier the recursion and storage of the sets.

  Abstract                 = {{We present in this paper a novel nonlinear model predictive control scheme that guarantees asymptotic closed-loop stability. The scheme can be applied to both stable and unstable systems with input constraints. The objective functional to be minimized consists of an integral square error (ISE) part over a finite time horizon plus a quadratic terminal cost. The terminal state penalty matrix of the terminal cost term has to be chosen as the solution of an appropriate Lyapunov equation. Furthermore, the setup includes a terminal inequality constraint that forces the states at the end of the finite prediction horizon to lie within a prescribed terminal region. If the Jacobian linearization of the nonlinear system to be controlled is stabilizable, we prove that feasibility of the open-loop optimal control problem at time t = 0 implies asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system. The size of the region of attraction is only restricted by the requirement for feasibility of the optimization problem due to the input and terminal inequality constraints and is thus maximal in some sense.

  Abstract                 = {{Strong feasibility of MPC problems is usually enforced by constraining the state at the final prediction step to a controlled invariant set. However, such terminal constraints fail to enforce strong feasibility in a rich class of MPC problems, for example when employing move-blocking. in this paper a generalized, least restrictive approach for enforcing strong feasibility of MPC problems is proposed and applied to move-blocking MPC. The approach hinges on the novel concept of controlled invariant feasibility. Instead of a terminal constraint, the state of an earlier prediction step is constrained to a controlled invariant feasible set. Controlled invariant feasibility is a generalization of controlled invariance. The convergence of well-known approaches for determining maximum controlled invariant sets, and j-step admissible sets. is formally proved. Thus an algorithm for rigorously approximating maximum controlled invariant feasible sets is developed for situations where the exact maximum cannot be determined. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

  Abstract                 = {{In this paper we introduce a new notion which we call convex-concave extensions. Convex-concave extensions provide for given nonlinear functions convex lower bound functions and concave upper bound functions, and can be viewed as a generalization of interval extensions. Convex-concave extensions can approximate the shape of a given function in a better way than interval extensions which deliver only constant lower and upper bounds for the range. Therefore, convex-concave extensions can be applied in a more flexible manner. For example, they can be used to construct convex relaxations. Moreover, it is demonstrated that in many cases the overestimation which is due to interval extensions can be drastically reduced. Applications and some numerical examples, including constrained global optimization problems of large scale, are presented.}},

It allows such controllers to be implemented via an efficient binary tree search, avoiding real-time optimization. This is of significant benefit in applications that requires low real-time computational complexity or low software complexity. The method has a priori guarantee of asymptotic stability with region of attraction being a close inner approximation to the stabilizable set. This is achieved by ensuring that the approximation error does not exceed the stability margin. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

First, it is shown that, given a parametric linear program (PLP), a polyhedron exists whose projection provides the solution to the PLP. Second, the converse is tackled and it is shown how to formulate a PLP whose solution is the projection of an appropriately defined polyhedron described as the intersection of a finite number of halfspaces. The input to one operation can be converted to an input of the other operation and the resulting output can be converted back to the desired form in polynomial time-this implies that algorithms for computing projections or methods for solving parametric linear programs can be applied to either problem class.}},

  Abstract                 = {{An understanding of invariant set theory is essential in the design of controllers for constrained systems, since state and control constraints can be satisfied if and only if the initial state belongs to a positively invariant set for the closed-loop system. The paper briefly reviews some concepts in invariant set theory and shows that the various sets can be computed using a single recursive algorithm. The ideas presented in the first part of the paper are applied to the fundamental design goal of guaranteeing feasibility in predictive control. New necessary and sufficient conditions based on the control horizon, prediction horizon and terminal constraint set are given in order to guarantee that the predictive control problem will be feasible for all time, given any feasible initial state.}},

  Abstract                 = {{This paper provides a solution to the problem of robust output feedback model predictive control of constrained, linear, discrete-time systems in the presence of bounded state and output disturbances. The proposed output feedback controller consists of a simple, stable Luenberger state estimator and a recently developed, robustly stabilizing, tube-based, model predictive controller. The state estimation error is bounded by an invariant set. The tube-based controller ensures that all possible realizations of the state trajectory lie in a simple uncertainty tube the `center' of which is the solution of a nominal (disturbance-free) system and the `cross-section' of which is also invariant. Satisfaction of the state and input constraints for the original system is guaranteed by employing tighter constraint sets for the nominal system. The complexity of the resultant controller is similar to that required for nominal model predictive control. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

  Abstract                 = {{A version of dynamic programming, which computes level sets of the value function rather than the value function set itself, is used to design robust non-linear controllers for linear, discrete-time, dynamical systems subject to hard constraints on controls and states. The controller stabilizes the system and steers all trajectories emanating in a prescribed set to a control invariant set in minimum time. For the robust regulator problem, the control invariant terminal set is a neighborhood, preferably small, of the origin; for the robust tracking problem, the control invariant terminal set is a neighborhood of the invariant set in which the tracking error is zero. Two non-linear controllers which utilize the level sets of the value function, are described. The first requires the controller to solve, on-line, a modest linear program whose dimension is approximately the same as that of the control variable. The second decomposes each level set into a set of simplices; a piecewise linear control law, affine in each simplex, is then constructed. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

  Abstract                 = {{We present a method for the construction of a robust dual-mode, receding horizon controller which can be employed for a wide class of nonlinear systems with state and control constraints and model error. The controller is dual-mode. In a neighborhood of the origin, the control action is generated by a linear feedback controller designed for the linearized system. Outside this neighborhood, receding horizon control is employed. Existing receding horizon controllers for nonlinear, continuous time systems, which are guaranteed to stabilize the nonlinear system to which they are applied, require the exact solution, at every instant, of an optimal control problem with terminal equality constraints. These requirements are considerably relaxed in the dual-mode receding horizon controller presented in this paper. Stability is achieved by imposing a terminal inequality, rather than an equality, constraint. Only approximate minimization is required. A variable time horizon is permitted. Robustness is achieved by employing conservative state and stability constraint sets, thereby permitting a margin of error. The resultant dual-mode controller requires considerably less on-line computation than existing receding horizon controllers for nonlinear, constrained systems.}},

  Abstract                 = {{The influence of used norm and corresponding Lipschitz constant to the speed of branch and bound algorithm for Multidimensional global optimization has been investigated. Lipschitz constants of different test functions for global optimization corresponding to different norms have been estimated. The test functions have been optimized using branch and bound algorithm for Lipschitz optimization with different norms. Experiments have shown that the best results are achieved when the combination of extreme (infinite and First) and Euclidean norms is used.}},

  Abstract                 = {{An algorithm for computing the maximal controlled invariant set and the least restrictive controller for discrete time systems is proposed. We show how the algorithm can be encoded using quantifier elimination, which leads to a semi-decidability result for definable systems. For discrete time linear systems with all sets specified by linear inequalities, a more efficient implementation is proposed using Linear programming and Fourier elimination. If in addition the system is in controllable canonical form, the input is scalar and unbounded, the disturbance is scalar and bounded and the initial set is a rectangle, then the problem is decidable.}},
